# React Node PostgreSQL Passport Multi Auth Examples
This repo was made to show example of using PassportJS in a Node server to setup authentication using multiple platforms. Local auth, which uses an email and password that the user provides. Gmail, where a user can use their Gmail account to authenticate. Twitter, where a user will use their twitter credentials to authenticate. Github, where a user uses their Github account to authenticate. Facebook, where a user uses their Facebook credentials.
